## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - - For client side routing

### What I learned

-How to **successfully implement react router** into the project.
<br />

- **The object-position property in CSS**: it is used together with object-fit to specify how an 'img' or 'video' should be positioned with x/y coordinates inside its "own content box".

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

<br/>

- Use the **ThemeProvider wrapper component** from the styled components library to switch between light and dark theme.

### Useful resources

- [Object-position W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_object-position.php) - This helped me to display the right aspect of my image on Home page.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
